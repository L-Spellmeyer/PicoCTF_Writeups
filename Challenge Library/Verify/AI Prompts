picoCTF Challenge: File Integrity Verification
Summary
Challenge Description: The objective of this challenge, authored by Jeffrey John, is to verify the authenticity of a provided flag file among multiple files by comparing SHA-256 checksums. The challenge is structured to reinforce the importance of checksum validation in ensuring file integrity, helping prevent the use of imitation or altered files. Along with the challenge, a SHA-256 hash and a decryption script are provided for validation purposes.

Classification: Easy
Keywords: Forensics, checksum, SHA-256, grep, sha256sum, picoCTF 2024
Hints Provided:

Checksums can validate a file's completeness and originality. A mismatch in checksums indicates a different file.
The SHA-256 checksum for files in a directory can be created with sha256sum <directory>/*.
Command outputs can be piped to refine searches, such as using | to direct sha256sum results to grep for efficient searching.
Step-by-Step Solution Guide
Examine the Initial Files
Using the cat command, I reviewed each file provided in the challenge to understand the file structure and contents. This allowed me to see what types of data were present in each file, including the checksum.txt file that contained the legitimate flag’s SHA-256 hash.

Initial Attempts with grep
I initially attempted to use grep to search within the directory where the files were located. My goal was to match the contents of checksum.txt against the other files, looking for any matches. However, this did not yield the intended results, indicating that a direct grep on the checksum.txt data might not be sufficient.

Creating a Hash of the Files for Comparison
Next, I generated the SHA-256 hashes for each file in the target directory using sha256sum files/*. This command outputs each file’s hash, allowing for a direct comparison against the checksum in checksum.txt.

Using grep to Match Hashes
I then redirected the output of the sha256sum files/* command to grep, using the contents of checksum.txt as the search key. This approach successfully returned one specific file in the directory, confirming a match between this file’s hash and the checksum provided.

Running the Decryption Script
After identifying the matching file, I used the provided decrypt.sh script, specifying the matched file path as the argument. Running this script produced the desired flag.

Obtaining the Flag
The decryption script returned the flag: picoCTF{trust_but_verify_451fd69b}, indicating successful completion of the challenge.

Key Takeaways
Importance of Checksums for File Integrity
This challenge underscored the utility of checksums like SHA-256 in confirming file authenticity. Matching a file’s checksum against a known valid checksum ensures the file’s origin and integrity, which is especially valuable in security contexts.

Effective Use of Piping and grep
Using piping to send sha256sum output directly to grep demonstrated a powerful technique for streamlining searches. This approach simplifies workflows when working with multiple files, allowing direct search and comparison against specific data without intermediate files.

Troubleshooting and Refining Commands
The challenge illustrated the importance of refining commands to achieve the desired results. Initial attempts that did not yield results required small adjustments, such as searching specific data or adjusting the command syntax, which ultimately led to success.

Command Alternatives and Flexibility
While cat was effective for viewing file contents, exploring alternatives like head and tail could be useful for viewing larger files. The experience reinforced the flexibility needed in using Linux command-line tools, as adapting approaches can expedite solutions in file verification and integrity scenarios.

This documentation outlines the systematic approach to solving the "File Integrity Verification" challenge, providing both practical insights and fundamental skills useful for similar forensics or security tasks.

ChatGPT
Here’s a revised, more direct step-by-step guide with explanations of each command used:

Step-by-Step Solution Guide
Review File Contents

Command: cat <file>
Explanation: The cat command displays the contents of a specified file. I used cat on each file in the directory to understand what was provided, focusing on the checksum.txt file, which contained the valid SHA-256 hash of the flag.
Generate SHA-256 Hashes for All Files

Command: sha256sum files/*
Explanation: sha256sum generates SHA-256 checksums for files. Using files/* runs this command on all files in the "files" directory, providing each file’s hash and file name. This was done to match each file’s hash against the known checksum in checksum.txt.
Search for Matching Hash with grep

Command: sha256sum files/* | grep -F "$(cat checksum.txt)"
Explanation: Piping (|) the output of sha256sum files/* to grep allowed a direct search for the specific hash stored in checksum.txt. The -F option in grep treats the input as a fixed string, avoiding interpretation as a regular expression. Using $(cat checksum.txt) substitutes the contents of checksum.txt as the search term in grep, finding the matching file by hash.
Decrypt the Verified File

Command: ./decrypt.sh <file>
Explanation: The provided decrypt.sh script requires the file path of the verified flag as input. Running this script with the identified file as an argument decrypts it to reveal the flag.
Retrieve the Flag

Flag Returned: picoCTF{trust_but_verify_451fd69b}
Explanation: The successful decryption indicated that the file was genuine, completing the challenge and providing the correct flag.
This solution leverages file integrity verification techniques using basic Linux commands, demonstrating efficient ways to validate and search through files in forensics and security tasks.

Yes, the writeup is clear and direct, but a few additional details would make it even more beginner-friendly for someone new to these types of tasks. Here are some modifications that could help:

Add Context to Each Step
Briefly explaining why each command is being used would help beginners understand the purpose of each action, rather than just the technical steps.

Clarify Variable Parts of Commands
Beginners might be confused by placeholders (like <file> or files/*). Explicitly indicating these are examples and need to be replaced with actual file names or paths in their environment would prevent misunderstandings.

Provide Troubleshooting Tips
Common issues, such as permissions errors with ./decrypt.sh (if it isn’t executable by default), could be anticipated by offering a quick command to change file permissions.

Here’s a revised version with these enhancements:

Step-by-Step Solution Guide
Review Each File’s Content

Command: cat <file>
Explanation: cat displays the contents of a specified file. Starting by reading each file allows us to understand what is available, particularly focusing on checksum.txt which holds the valid SHA-256 hash for the genuine flag. This hash will be essential for identifying the correct file.
Generate SHA-256 Hashes for All Files in the Directory

Command: sha256sum files/*
Explanation: sha256sum generates a unique SHA-256 hash for each file, helping us verify each file’s integrity. Running this on files/* produces a list of hashes for every file in the “files” directory. We’ll compare these hashes against the known hash in checksum.txt.
Search for the Matching Hash Using grep

Command: sha256sum files/* | grep -F "$(cat checksum.txt)"
Explanation: Piping (|) the output of sha256sum files/* to grep lets us quickly search for the hash that matches the one in checksum.txt. The command $(cat checksum.txt) inserts the contents of checksum.txt as the search term, while -F treats it as a fixed string to avoid interpretation errors. If a match is found, grep returns the name of the correct file.
Decrypt the Verified File Using decrypt.sh

Command: ./decrypt.sh <file>
Explanation: This step runs the provided decryption script on the identified file (replace <file> with the matching file name). If you receive a “permission denied” error, run chmod +x decrypt.sh to make the script executable. Once decrypted, the script outputs the flag.
Retrieve the Flag

Flag Returned: picoCTF{trust_but_verify_451fd69b}
Explanation: Successfully decrypting the file confirms its authenticity and completes the challenge, revealing the flag.
