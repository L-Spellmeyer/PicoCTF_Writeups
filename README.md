# PicoCTF_Writeups
Hi, my name is Levi Spellmeyer. This repository is an ongoing project where I document my progress through picoCTF challenges. For each completed challenge, I will create a dedicated folder containing three files:

- Notes - This file captures my thought process, including what strategies worked and what didnâ€™t.
- Writeup - An AI-generated writeup of the challenge, based on my notes, with a citation for the AI used.
- Key Takeaways - Important insights, notable commands, and reflections on the challenge.

Each folder provides a comprehensive look at my approach, solutions, and learning from the challenges. The purpose of using generative ai to help generate the writeup itself is to expose myself to creating good prompts when using ai and to familiarize myself with the formal language used in writeups.
